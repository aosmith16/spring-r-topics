This is an informal class for students wanting to get a little extra practice in R. We will work together through material in real time.\r\nThe class will meet once per week for 2 hours over 10 weeks. Each class will be a mix of instruction on the topic, discussion, and active work in R. Materials (slides, links, R scripts) will be listed on the Materials page throughout the quarter, so check back each week.\r\nThe plan so far:\r\nWeek 01: Introduction to Git/GitHub\r\nWeek 02: Build a personal website with distill and postcards\r\nWeek 03: Deploy website using GitHub Pages\r\nWeek 04: Explore gt for making tables\r\nWeek 05: gt flair: colors, images, and themes\r\nWeek 06: Learn to write functions in R\r\nWeek 07: More Git: merge conflicts and pull requests\r\nWeek 08: Interactive graphics and tables\r\nWeek 09: Animated graphics (with gganimate)\r\nWeek 10: Catch up day or other topics of interest\r\nSoftware\r\nWe will be working in R via RStudio. Make sure you have up-to-date versions of both of these. Current versions:R 4.0.4RStudio 1.4\r\nPackages\r\nI’ll be adding to the package list throughout the term as we hammer out exactly what topics will be covered. You’ll want to install these on your computer so you’re ready to go.\r\ndistill v. 1.2postcards v. 0.2.0devtools v. 2.3.2fontawesome v. 0.1.0 (not 0.2.0)gt v. 0.2.2webshot v. 0.5.2dplyr v. 1.0.5 tidyr v. 1.1.3usethis v. 2.0.1gh v 1.2.1gganimate v. 1.0.7plotly v. 4.9.3leaflet v. 2.0.4.1dygraphs v. 1.1.1.6reactable v 0.2.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
