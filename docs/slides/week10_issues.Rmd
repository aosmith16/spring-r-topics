## Today's Goal

**Learn the process and etiquette for reporting issues on GitHub repositories `r fontawesome::fa("github")`**   

Using **reprex** skills learned last week, we will end by making a practice issue.

.center[
<br/>
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%", fig.alt = "Logo for package reprex"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/reprex.png")
```
]

---

## Resources

- See Yihui Xie's [GitHub issue guide](https://yihui.org/issue/). This guide is specific to repositories he maintains but contains good general advice for approaching the GitHub issue process.   

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues

The **Issues** section on GitHub is where you can report possible bugs or make feature requests.

This is part of a GitHub repository. See **Issues** in the second menu on the top navigation bar.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture showing the issues menu on the top menu bar in aosmith16/practice-repo GitHub repository"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/issue_menu.png")
```
]

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues

Take a moment to explore the issues section on the **ggplot2** repository at https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues.

.center[
<br/>
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture of the issues section for the ggplot2 GitHub repository"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/ggplot2_issues.png")
```
]

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues

Things to note:
- There are separate pages for open and closed issues
- There is a search bar at the top so you can search within issues
- You can sort issues using the drop-down menu on the far right; I sometimes look at "Recently updated" rather the newest
- You can create an issue by clicking on the "New issue" button on the right

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues 

I think I found a bug `r emo::ji("beetle")`; should I report it?

--

<br/>
Absolutely!

Reporting bugs is a way to help the package maintainer improve the package, which ultimately helps everyone who uses the package. `r emo::ji("raised_hands")` This is one way to participate in and give back to an open source programming language like R.

--

<br/>
It can feel scary `r emo::ji("fearful")`to report an issue, I think particularly for those of us who feel like non-R experts. 

To ease the process, we'll spend much of today's time going over some of the basic etiquette to follow when reporting an issue. 

???

I have occasionally reported bugs for students who found issues in packages. I hope this ultimately leads them to see the process so they will feel empowered to report issues in the future.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Report bugs and request features**

The issues section on GitHub is for reporting potential bugs `r emo::ji("beetle")` and requesting features. It is not for asking general questions about how the package works.

<br/>
If you have a question, ask on help forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) and the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).  

It may turn out that your question was due to a bug. In that case, go to the relevant GitHub repo and report it. `r emo::ji("smile")`

???

Already mentioned Yihui Xie's guide to etiquette on his repositories is a good place to start: https://yihui.org/issue/.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Do your research**

- Make sure you are using the most current version of the package. 

???

I'm thinking CRAN here, although the development version is also fair game.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Do your research**

- Make sure you are using the most current version of the package. 
- Before opening a new issue, check that no one else has reported it by searching both open and closed issues using the search tool.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture of the issues section for the ggplot2 GitHub repository"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/ggplot2_issues.png")
```
]

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Do your research**

- Make sure you are using the most current version of the package. 
- Before opening a new issue, check that no one else has reported it by searching both open and closed issues using the search tool.
- Go through the `NEWS` to check for any recent changes. This is usually on the first page of the repo and may be called `NEWS.md`. You may want to install the *development version* of the package directly from GitHub.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture showing where to check for changes in NEWS.md on the ggplot2 GitHub repository"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/news.png")
```

- If you feel unsure that what you found is really a bug, ask someone else to review your minimal reproducible example. This may be on one of the aforementioned forums.

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Follow all repository instructions**

Some repositories will give specific instructions on what you need to provide when opening an issue. 

.pull-left[
For example, if you open a **ggplot2** issue you will see a set of instructions. Make sure you read them and then do as they instruct.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture showing where to check for changes in NEWS.md on the ggplot2 GitHub repository"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/ggplot2_instr.png")
```
]

???

Notice that this repo asks for session info only if requested or you can hide it using **reprex** collapsible session info with `session_info = TRUE`.

Similarly, make sure you read Yihiu Xie's issue guide if opening issue on a repo he maintains. Most of his also have instructions included when opening the issue.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Be kind and respectful**

It seems like it would go without saying, but I've seen issues with an accusatory tone when something that used to work no longer does.

You may decide to offer up appreciation (if instructions allow for it `r emo::ji("grin")`) but at the very least use a respectful tone while you efficiently outline the potential problem. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Issues can feel oppressive to maintainers</p>&mdash; Jim Hester (@jimhester_) <a href='https://twitter.com/jimhester%5F/status/1357680037470875649'>Tweet February 5, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

???

Discussion of tweet: Issues are usually bug reports, which can feel really negative when that's the main feedback you get. Think about how the maintainer might feel when they see your report and try to set the tone accordingly.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Provide a minimal reproducible example**

The simpler the example you can give, the easier it is for the maintainer to understand the problem. 

Ideally you will provide very basic example code with output (when relevant). The maintainer should be able to copy, paste, and run the code with no other steps.

This is good use-case for package **reprex**.  

.center[
```{r distill, echo = FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.alt = "Logo for package reprex"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/reprex.png")
```
]

???

There are times when an issue doesn't need code, but those are rare

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Be patient**

You likely will not get an immediate response. Package maintainers are busy people and getting to issues takes time.

If you have a potential fix for an issue, you might consider making a pull request. 

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

**Be responsive if more information requested**

The repo maintainer may ask you for more background on the issue or feature request. Be sure to be paying attention so you can get back to them.

I've seen issues closed because the original poster never returned with follow up information.

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

Let's put these guidelines all in one slide.

- **Report bugs and request features**
- **Do your research**
- **Follow all repository instructions**
- **Be kind and respectful**
- **Provide a minimal reproducible example**
- **Be patient**
- **Be responsive if more information requested**

---

## GitHub `r icons::fontawesome("github")` issues etiquette

Before we finish up this section, there are just a couple of other things to think about.

First, if relevant, include an example of the result you expected vs the result you got.

Second, you may have found out important information in the **Do your research** stage that you should report to the maintainer.  

For example, if you found out when the change occurred, where in the source code the issue may be coming from, what used to happen, etc., you can include that information in your report.

---

## Issue examples

I went and found a couple of old issues I put in for package **tidyr**.

The first one is a feature request: https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/387 

???

Students should navigate to the issue

--

You can see I initially didn't give enough background and so had to come back with more information.

Also note that there was a delay before the maintainer was able to think about this, which is not uncommon with a feature request. 

You can "react" to posts within GitHub issues. Adding positive emoji reactions is one way to show appreciation. You can see such reactions on the very last post in the thread.

---

## Issue examples

The second was a bug report `r emo::ji("beetle")`: https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/issues/324

I did a better job of showing a really minimal example here to demonstrate the problem.

I also demonstrated the kind of output I was expecting to get.

---

## Practice issue

Let's finish today by taking with we learned with **reprex** last week and newly armed with our GitHub issues etiquette to practice making an issue.

--

You will practice opening an issue on my `practice-repo` repository: https://github.com/aosmith16/practice-repo

Go to that repo, navigate to the **Issues** section, and click on the green "New Issue" button.

---

## Practice issue

Fill in a title for your issue. In a real issue this title should be succinct but descriptive of the issue.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture adding the title `Reporting a problem with something in this repo' to the practice issue on the aosmith16/practice-repo repo"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/issue_title.png")
```
]

---

## Practice issue

Then describe the issue in the text. GitHub issues are written using Markdown, so you can add emphasis using that syntax, if needed.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture adding a written description of the problem into the main text box of the issue. This text is simple filler since this is a practice issue."}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/issue_descrip.png")
```
]

---

## Practice issue

Add some code and output via **reprex**. The two examples from last week are below for you to run in R if you'd like. Feel free to write your own **reprex** code. `r emo::ji("smile")`

.pull-left[
.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex({
    library(ggplot2)
    
ggplot(data = mtcars[2:3,], aes(x = factor(gear), y = mpg)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(vs)), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mpg - 1, ymax = mpg + 1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
})
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex(session_info = TRUE, {
    #+ message = FALSE, warning = FALSE
    library(dplyr)
    library(plyr)
    
    mtcars %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarise(mpg = mean(mpg))
})
```
]

---

## Practice issue

.pull-left[
Here's what the main text box looks like after pasting the output of my **reprex** code.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture showing what the main text box of an issue looks like after pasting in output from package reprex. The main text box is not rendered, so everything is in plain text using Markdown syntax."}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/issue_reprex.png")
```
]

---

## Practice issue

.pull-left[
Go to the `Preview` pane in GitHub to see the rendered code and output. 

You will always want to check that the rendered output looks correct.

<br/>
Code should always be correctly formatted. If writing code directly instead of pasting from **reprex**, wrap code chunk in 3 back-ticks. See an example [here](https://yihui.org/issue/#please-format-your-issue-correctly).
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen capture showing the preview pane of the code and output pasted from package reprex. The preview pane shows the rendered version of all text and code."}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week10_files/issue_preview.png")
```
]

---

## Practice issue

Once you have written out the problem, included the example, and made sure everything was formatted correctly in the `Preview`, you're ready to submit! `r emo::ji("tada")`

Submit your issue via the `Submit new issue` button at the bottom of your issue.

--

<br/><br/>
If you get a response on your issue you will be notified on GitHub and via email. 

.center[
<br/>
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.alt = "Screenshot showing the blue dot on the bell in GitHub that indicates you have a notification"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week07_files/notification.png")
```
]

???

Try to monitor for notifications at least a little so you can respond, if needed.

---

## Fin

And with that, we are done for the quarter. Enjoy your summer! `r emo::ji("sun_with_face")`
