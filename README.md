# Advanced R topics

This is the repository to make a website for an informal, 1-credit class for graduate students in spring term 2021.  These are *advanced* in the sense that the plan is to cover tools that students are not normally exposed to when they are introduced to R. It can be nice to work on such topics as a group rather than each student needing to learn on their own.

The plan is to go over:
- Introduction to Git/GitHub  
- Build a personal website with **distill** and **postcards**  
- Learn to write functions  
- Explore **gt** for making tables  
- Animated graphics (with **gganimate**)  
- Interactive graphics (?)  

At the moment I plan on keeping the slides and other materials in this same repository so I can add them as links in the website.
