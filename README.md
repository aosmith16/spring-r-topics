# Advanced R topics

This is the repository to make a website for an informal, 1-credit class for graduate students in spring term 2021.  These are *advanced* topics in the sense that the plan is to cover tools that students are not normally exposed to when they are introduced to R. It can be nice to work on such topics as a group rather than each student needing to learn on their own.

The plan is to go over:
Week 01: Introduction to Git/GitHub  
Week 02: Build a personal website with **distill** and **postcards**  
Week 03: Deploy website using GitHub Pages  
Week 04: Explore **gt** for making tables  
Week 05: **gt** flair: colors, images, and themes    
Week 06: Learn to write functions in R  
Week 07: More Git: forking and pull requests  
Week 08: Animated graphics (with **gganimate**)  
Week 09: Interactive graphics and tables     
Week 10: Other topics of interest  

At the moment I plan on keeping the slides and other materials in this same repository so I can add them as links in the website.
