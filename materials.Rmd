## Week 1: Introducing Git and GitHub

### Goals

**Create version-controlled directory for your future website!**

But also: 

-    Create GitHub account  
-    Install Git  
-    Introduce yourself to Git  
-    Create first repository and link to it in R/RStudio  

### Resources

We will rely heavily on [Happy Git and GitHub with
R](https://happygitwithr.com/), in particular chapters 4, 6, 7, 11, and
12

### Materials for class

[Week 01 slides](slides/week01_introduction_git_and_github.html)

## Week 2: Create a distill website

### Goals

**Create a personal website to showcase your work**

- Create distill website in version-controlled directory  
- Edit `_site.yml` to control website design  
- Edit index.Rmd to add personal details with **postcard**  
- Change website appearance with a basic theme change  

### Resources

The **distill** website has great material for getting started: <https://rstudio.github.io/distill/>\
Tom Mock has a nice intro to **distill**
[here](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/)\
Alison Hill's post on **postcards**
[here](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-12-22-postcards-distill/)  
The [distillery showcase](https://jhelvy.github.io/distillery/showcase.html) is great for inspiration and ideas on website design

### Materials for class

[Week 02 slides](slides/week02_distill_websites.html)

## Week 3: More on **distill** articles and deploy website

### Goals

Ultimately we will deploy our websites via GitHub Pages

But first:  

- Add more **distill** articles to the website  
- Create citation entry  
- Add `.bib` file for references  
- Practice with footnotes, asides, and appendices  
- Add drop down menus and links within website pages  

### Resources

The **distill** website has articles on [**distill** basics](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/basics.html) as well as [citations](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html)  
GitHub docs has an overview of publishing via GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

### Materials for class

[Week 03 slides](slides/week03_distill_articles_deploy.html)  
Save [.bib example file](files/article1.bib)  

## Week 4: Intro to display tables with **gt**

### Goals

Make display tables for output documents (e.g., manuscripts, presentations) using the **gt** package. We're starting with the basics: controlling the table content, adding information to the table, changing the table look, and saving to different formats.

### Resources

Thomas Mock has made a [**gt** Cookbook](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook.html#Introduction) that goes through functions in great detail.  
The **gt** package website has a nice [intro](https://gt.rstudio.com/articles/intro-creating-gt-tables.html).  

### Materials

Slides here  
Save [`week04_gt_basics.Rmd`](files/week04_gt_basics.Rmd) to run code during the session  

## Week 5: Doing more with **gt** tables.

### Goals

We'll look at a few more advanced features of **gt**, including adding images, using colors in cells, and highlighting values. We may also look at some more complex examples based on [Jonathan Schwabish's "Ten Guidelines to Better Tables"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/abs/ten-guidelines-for-better-tables/74C6FD9FEB12038A52A95B9FBCA05A12).

### Resources

The **gt** Cookbook has a section on [colors](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook.html#Conditional_formatting).  
Thomas Mock wrote a [post](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/) based on the "Ten Guidelines to Better Tables" paper that recreates tables with **gt**.  
Liam Bailey walks through a more complex **gt** [table-making example](https://www.liamdbailey.com/post/making-beautiful-tables-with-gt/).  
[Advanced **gt** Cookbook](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook-advanced.html)

### Materials
