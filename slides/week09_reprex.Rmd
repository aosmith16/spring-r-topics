## What is a reprex?

The term *reprex* stands for **repr**oducible **ex**ample.

If you ever ask for R help on a forum or want to report an issue on a GitHub repository you will be asked for example code that reproduces the problem; a *reprex*.

--

<br/><br/>
Here are several nice overviews on how to make a reproducible example that are worth reading.

[RStudio Community guide](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-how-to-do-a-minimal-reproducible-example-reprex-for-beginners/23061)

## What is in a reprex?

<br/>
A reprex should include:    
    
> - A minimal dataset, necessary to reproduce the issue  

> - The minimal runnable code necessary to reproduce the issue, which can be run
on the given dataset, and including the necessary information on the used packages.

## What is in a reprex?

<br/>
A reprex should include:

> - the minimal runnable code necessary to reproduce the error, which can be run on the given dataset  
> - all necessary information on the used packages, the R version, and the OS it is run on.  

> - in the case of random processes, a seed (set by set.seed()) for reproducibility  

*From the Stack Overflow thread on reproducible examples*

--

<br/>
Note the consistent use of the word ***minimal***.

???

We'll be talking about minimal later.

---

## Why should I reprex?

Making a minimal, reproducible example can take time. It can be easy to convince yourself to skip the process and "just get the help I need".

But the time is ultimately worth spending. `r emo::ji("dollar")`

--


> - 80% of the time creating an excellent reprex reveals the source of your problem. Itâ€™s amazing how often the process of writing up a self-contained and minimal example allows you to answer your own question.  

> - The other 20% of time you will have captured the essence of your problem in a way that is easy for others to play with. This substantially improves your chances of getting help!

*From the tidyverse help guide*

???

A lot of times you can solve your own problem while working towards a minimal, reproducible example.

And you will be asked for one! I included this tweet to focus on the picture of the shared slide.

---

## The plan for today

- I will introduce an R coding scenario that I need your help solving
- We'll go through my attempts to provide a reproducible example, with you running the code I provide
- We'll discuss how I can improve things so my code meets the definition of a minimal reproducible example
- Finally, we'll practice using package **reprex** to get code and output ready to paste into a forum and then discuss more features of the package  

--

<br/>
This gets us ready for next week when we'll
- Talk about GitHub issues and issue etiquette  
- Practice making an issue, writing text and pasting **reprex** code

???

GitHub issues was originally in this same slide deck but I decided it'd be better to use the time in a separate working session.

## "I need help" take 1 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

**Me:** "I'm having a problem with my **ggplot2** code. My points dodge but my error bars don't. Help! Here is my code."

**You:** Copy and paste the code below into your R Console and run.  What happens?

.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("#1c5253", "#F4790B"),
                       labels = c("Douglas-fir", "Red alder")) +
    labs(color = "Species",
         x = "Overstory",
         y = "Estimate") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),

          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "pt"),
          plot.margin = margin(b = 0))
```
]

---

## "I need help" take 1 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`


```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat('Error in ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) : 
  could not find function "ggplot"')
```

When the error message indicates a function can't be found, most often the package wasn't loaded. 

That's the case here. I didn't provide the packages I'm using in my example code.

--

<br/><br/>
You might now be thinking, "Well, geez, people can easily guess what package I'm using based on my code."

Help people help you! `r emo::ji("hugs")` To maximize the chance of getting help you should make it as easy as possible for people to provide that help.  Include your packages code, even if you think they're obvious.

???

This is the classic "help me help you" slide

---

## "I need help" take 1 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

Going back to the info in the guides for reproducible examples, I should provide:

> ...runnable code necessary to reproduce the issue, which can be run
on the given dataset, and including the necessary information on the used packages.

<br/>
OK, I didn't give code for the data or packages in my first attempt. Let me try again.

---

## "I need help" take 2 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

## "I need help" take 2 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

**You:** Are likely feeling overwhelmed right now because I just gave you a ton of code. `r emo::ji("laughing")`

--

<br/>
I asked you earlier to note the use of the word ***minimal*** used over and over in the reproducible example descriptions we read.

Let's talk more about that now.

---

## *Minimal* code

When asked to provide the package and dataset I made a reasonable attempt to do so. However, I went way too far and provided code that wasn't relevant to the problem.

--

<br/>
When providing an example, give the absolute minimum amount of code that can reproduce the problem. No extra packages, no extra data manipulation steps, etc. 

<br/>
Give the final dataset; the person helping you should not have to run a bunch of code to create it. (*More on datasets coming up.*)

???

Don't make your potential helpers run all the code to create a dataset in a bunch of data manipulation steps. Provide them the final dataset.

---

## *Minimal* code

Even when I get rid of the extraneous packages and data manipulation steps my code isn't minimal.

All tweaks to the plot appearance, such as those highlighted below, are not related to the problem I am having. This code should be removed.

.tiny[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/Users/USER/Documents/MyProject")

mydata = read.csv("all_results.csv")

ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("#1c5253", "#F4790B"), #<<
                       labels = c("Douglas-fir", "Red alder")) + #<<
    labs(color = "Species", #<<
         x = "Overstory", #<<
         y = "Estimate") + #<<
    theme_minimal() + #<<
    theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), #<<
          panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), #<<
          legend.direction = "horizontal", #<<
          legend.position = "bottom", #<<
          legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "pt"), #<<
          plot.margin = margin(b = 0)) #<<
```
]

---

## "I need help" take 3 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

Me: "OK, I got things down to just the code that produces the problem. Here you go!"

You: Copy and paste the code into your R Console and run.  What happens now?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/Users/USER/Documents/MyProject")

mydata = read.csv("all_results.csv")

ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
```

---

## "I need help" take 3 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat('Error in setwd("C:/Users/USER/Documents/MyProject") : 
  cannot change working directory')
cat(paste0('Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") :
  cannot open file),', "'all_project_data.csv': No such file or directory"))
```

<br/>
These errors are related to the dataset. 

I provided code for loading the dataset but you don't have access to the data stored on my computer.

---

## The problem of setwd()

We're going to talk more about how to provide datasets. First let's talk about my use of `setwd()` when asking someone else to run my code who doesn't have access to my computer.

--

An excerpt from ["Reprex do's and don'ts"](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) captures the problem better than I can: 

> **Pack it in, pack it out, and donâ€™t take liberties with other peopleâ€™s computers.** You are asking people to run this code!

> - Donâ€™t start with `rm(list = ls())`. It is anti-social to clobber other peopleâ€™s workspaces.

> - Donâ€™t start with `setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")`, because it wonâ€™t work on anyone elseâ€™s computer.

--

<br/>
Your goal is to make it easy for someone else to run your code, and `setwd()` doesn't do that.

If you regularly use `setwd()` in your work, consider switching to [Project-oriented workflows](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). 

???

Can add asides here about issues of `setwd()` for your future self or your self using a different computer.

---

## Providing a dataset

The thing I've seen people struggle with the most when making a reprex is in providing a dataset.

This is a place where making a reproducible example can get a time-consuming.

--

<br/>
The three most common ways to provide a dataset in a reproducible example:
1. Use a built-in dataset like `mtcars` `r emo::ji("car")`.
2. Create a fake dataset.
3. Provide some portion of your real dataset using **datapasta**.

---

### Use a built-in dataset

Our reprex focus is on making it as easy as possible for others to run our code.

Editing your code to work with one of the datasets built in to R is a good approach for this. These datasets are available to all R users with no effort. 

--

<br/>
Commonly used datasets include `mtcars` `r emo::ji("car")` and `iris` `r emo::ji("blossom")`, but there are a bunch more.  Run `data()` in your R Console to see all available datasets that come with R.

You can also opt to use datasets that come with add-on packages. However, that requires your potential helpers to have that package.

---

### Use a built-in dataset

Using built-in data means I have to edit my code to work with a different dataset. This can be a time-consuming process `r emo::ji("hourglass_flowing_sand")`, but gets easier with practice. 

I took `mtcars` `r emo::ji("car")` and rewrote the code to reproduce my problem. I chose just two rows of the dateset with the same value of `gear` but different values of `vs`.

Copy the code and run it in your R Console to see the result.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = mtcars[2:3,], aes(x = factor(gear), y = mpg)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(vs)), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mpg - 1, ymax = mpg + 1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
```

???

Also note how I didn't need actual values in the dataset for making error bars.

The take home here is that the problem doesn't have to do with my real data

---

### Create fake data

Another way to provide data is to make a fake dataset. This can be a good option if your data are proprietary, for example. 

Fake data can be a straightforward way to provide a *minimal* dataset to reproduce the problem, especially if you aren't familiar with any of the built-in datasets. 

--

<br/>
I will show an example of making fake data on the next slide. Creating fake data takes practice, and may feel difficult when you first try it. Stick with it, it gets easier! `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`

???

Many problems can be reproduced without working with your entire real dataset

---

### Create fake data

.pull-left[
Here is an example of making a small dataset via `data.frame()` that matches the features and variables in my real dataset but with simplified values. 

<br/>
Since my problem is with dodging I only need a single `x` variable group to reproduce the problem. My fake dataset ends up having two rows.
]

.pull-right[
.smaller[
```{r}
mydata = data.frame(over_species = c("ACMA", "ACMA"),
                    spp = c("DF", "RA"),
                    est1 = c(1, 2),
                    lo1 = c(1, 2) - 2,
                    hi1 = c(1, 2) + 2)
mydata
```
]
]

.footnote[See other ways to make fake data, such as with functions from package **tibble**, in this [RStudio Community thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/best-practices-how-to-prepare-your-own-data-for-use-in-a-reprex-if-you-can-t-or-don-t-know-how-to-reproduce-a-problem-with-a-built-in-dataset/5346/8).]

---

### Create fake data

The beauty of making a fake dataset is that you can include the code for creating it along with the rest of your code.

Copy the code and run it in your R Console to see the result.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mydata = data.frame(over_species = rep("ACMA", times = 2),
                        spp = c("DF", "RA"),
                        est1 = c(1, 2),
                        lo1 = c(1, 2) - 2,
                        hi1 = c(1, 2) + 2)

ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
```

**Note:** If your example contains randomly generated numbers, be sure to provide a seed with `set.seed()`.

### Using **datapasta** to provide data

If you want to provide your actual dataset you can use helper functions from package **datapasta**. 

There are other options for doing this, such as function `dput()`, but **datapasta** puts the result in a nice, readable format.

--

<br/>
We'll be using `datapasta::dpasta()` to briefly explore how this works.

There is much more you can do with **datapasta** then what we'll do here. Check out [How to Datapasta](https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/articles/how-to-datapasta.html) for neat examples on copying and pasting data from online sources, etc.

---

class: with-logo logo-pasta

### Using **datapasta** to provide data

Run the code below in your R Console to see how `dpasta()` turns the first few rows and columns of `mtcars` into an easily copy-and-pasteable format. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
datapasta::dpasta(mtcars[1:6, 1:3])
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data.frame(
   row.names = c("Mazda RX4","Mazda RX4 Wag","Datsun 710",
                 "Hornet 4 Drive","Hornet Sportabout","Valiant"),
         mpg = c(21, 21, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1),
         cyl = c(6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6),
        disp = c(160, 160, 108, 258, 360, 225)
)
```

**Note:** I found slight alignment issue with the output format from `dpasta()`, as shown above. When formatting the output `Ctrl + I` (MacOS `Cmd + I`) will fix that right up. `r emo::ji("+1")`

---

class: with-logo logo-pasta

### Using **datapasta** to provide data

This is the approach I want in order to include my actual dataset with my code.

Here's what my actual dataset looks like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(16)

mydata = tibble::tibble(over_species = rep(c("ACMA", "ALRU", "PSME"), each = 2),
                    spp = rep(c("DF", "RA"), times = 3),
                    est1 = round(runif(n = 6, min = 5, max = 15), digits = 1),
                    lo1 = est1 - 2,
                    hi1 = est1 + 2,
                    est2 = round(runif(n = 6, min = 10, max = 30), digits = 1),
                    lo2 = est2 - 5,
                    hi2 = est2 + 5,
                    var1 = round(rnorm(n = 6), digits = 1),
                    var2 = round(rnorm(n = 6), digits = 1)
           )

knitr::kable(mydata)
```

Take note of all the extra columns. In keeping with making things minimal, I'll remove all columns not directly relevant to the problem prior to using `dpasta()`.

## "I need help" take 4 `r emo::ji("clapper_board")`

**Me:** "I'm having a problem with my **ggplot2** code. My points dodge but my error bars don't. Help! Here is a minimal reproducible example."

**You:** You can now copy and paste the code into your R Console and immediately get it to run. `r emo::ji("tada")`

.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mydata = data.frame(
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
    over_species = c("ACMA", "ACMA", "ALRU", "ALRU", "PSME", "PSME"),
    spp = c("DF", "RA", "DF", "RA", "DF", "RA"),
    est1 = c(11.8, 7.4, 9.5, 7.3, 13.6, 8.1),
    lo1 = c(9.8, 5.4, 7.5, 5.3, 11.6, 6.1),
    hi1 = c(13.8, 9.4, 11.5, 9.3, 15.6, 10.1)
)

ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
```
]

???

I did re-format the output from dpasta() with Ctrl + I

You can now immediately start helping me instead of figuring out what I meant :)

## The reprex package

The goal of this package is to 
>Render bits of R code for sharing, e.g., on GitHub or StackOverflow

--

<br/>
The package takes a chunk of your code and runs it, returning both the code and the code output on your clipboard. Paste the result into your question on Stack Overflow or when reporting a potential issue on GitHub.

This allows someone to copy your code and run it. Importantly, they can also see what the output looks like *without having to run any code at all*.

## The reprex package

One way simple way to use the **reprex** package is to copy the code from your minimal reproducible example onto your clipboard.

Here's my working example to copy again:

.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

mydata = data.frame(
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
    over_species = c("ACMA", "ACMA", "ALRU", "ALRU", "PSME", "PSME"),
    spp = c("DF", "RA", "DF", "RA", "DF", "RA"),
    est1 = c(11.8, 7.4, 9.5, 7.3, 13.6, 8.1),
    lo1 = c(9.8, 5.4, 7.5, 5.3, 11.6, 6.1),
    hi1 = c(13.8, 9.4, 11.5, 9.3, 15.6, 10.1)
)

ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
               position = position_dodge(width = .5),
               size = 2) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                  position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                  width = .2)
```
]

class: with-logo logo-reprex

## The reprex package

.pull-left[
Once you have code copied to your clipboard, run `reprex::reprex()` in your R Console.

<br/>
All code and output will be copied to your clipboard and a rendered HTML preview will show in your `Viewer` Pane. 

<br/>
The result is automatically put on your clipboard, ready to be pasted and render correctly on GitHub or Stack Overflow. (*We will practice this next week.*)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after copying my reproducible example code and then running reprex::reprex() in my R Console"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex1.png")
```
]

## The reprex package

An alternative to the copying + `reprex()` technique is to wrap your reproducible example code within curly braces inside `reprex::reprex()`. Copy and run the following:

.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex({
    library(ggplot2)
    
    mydata = data.frame(
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
        over_species = c("ACMA", "ACMA", "ALRU", "ALRU", "PSME", "PSME"),
        spp = c("DF", "RA", "DF", "RA", "DF", "RA"),
        est1 = c(11.8, 7.4, 9.5, 7.3, 13.6, 8.1),
        lo1 = c(9.8, 5.4, 7.5, 5.3, 11.6, 6.1),
        hi1 = c(13.8, 9.4, 11.5, 9.3, 15.6, 10.1)
    )
    
    ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = over_species, y = est1)) +
        geom_point(aes(color = spp), 
                   position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                   size = 2) +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lo1, ymax = hi1),
                      position = position_dodge(width = .5),
                      width = .2)
})
```
]

## The reprex package

Let's do another example.

.pull-left[
Here's the classic **dplyr** before **plyr** problem with `summarise()`. Copy and run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex({
    library(dplyr)
    library(plyr)
    
    mtcars %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarise(mpg = mean(mpg))
})
```

Note the many, many messages from the packages.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after using the dplyr-plyr code in reprex::reprex()"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex_dplyr.png")
```
]

### Suppress startup messages

In this case one of the start-up messages is directly relevant to the problem.  However, often when asking for help it is not useful to include the start-up messages and you'd want to suppress them.

.pull-left[
One option is to use `suppressPackageStartupMessages()` on chatty packages like **dplyr**.

.smaller[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex({
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plyr))
    
    mtcars %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarise(mpg = mean(mpg))
})
```
]
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after using the dplyr-plyr code in reprex::reprex() while suppressing messages"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex_dplyr2.png")
```

<br/>
Note the output from the code is commented out. This allows someone else to copy the entire chunk of example code, including any output, and run it without trouble.
]

---

class: with-logo logo-reprex

### Suppress startup messages

Another option is to use a special comment that work like Rmd chunks, `#+`, to add **knitr** chunk options to suppress messages and warnings.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex({
    #+ message = FALSE, warning = FALSE
    library(dplyr)
    library(plyr)
    
    mtcars %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarise(mpg = mean(mpg))
})
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after using the dplyr-plyr code in reprex::reprex() while suppressing messages with #+ chunks"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex_dplyr3.png")
```
]

### Adding your session info

Your *session info* includes information on your operating system, R version, and package versions. It can be relevant to some problems in R.

Unfortunately the session info can get very long.  This can distract from the question, and sometimes you will be explicitly asked *not* to provide it unless requested.

--

<br/><br/>
**reprex** allows you to add your session info in a collapsible format on GitHub using the `session_info` argument. 

**Note:** Stack Overflow does not allow for collapsible sections at this time so the entirety of your session info will show there if using this option.

???

This is useful, as it allows you to provide your session info but it doesn't take up a ton of space.

---

class: with-logo logo-reprex

### Adding your session info

Add session info with `session_info = TRUE`.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reprex::reprex(session_info = TRUE, {
    #+ message = FALSE, warning = FALSE
    library(dplyr)
    library(plyr)
    
    mtcars %>%
        group_by(cyl) %>%
        summarise(mpg = mean(mpg))
})
```

<br/>
You can see a session info section is included but collapsed in the rendered view.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after using the dplyr-plyr code in reprex::reprex() with collapsed session info"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex_session.png")
```
]

class: with-logo logo-reprex

### Adding your session info

Here's what opening the session info arrow looks like.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Screen shot showing the Viewer Pane after using the dplyr-plyr code in reprex::reprex() with session info uncollapsed"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week09_files/reprex_session_long.png")
```

## Next week

- We'll discuss the process and etiquette for reporting issues on GitHub `r fontawesome::fa("github")` repositories 
- We will take the time to make a practice GitHub issue, using package **reprex** to add code and output
