# Build a personal website with distill
## Part 2: Adding articles and deploying your website

```{r distill, echo = FALSE, out.width = "15%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/distill.png")
```

## Today's Goal

Overall

- **Deploy your personal website**

--

But first 
-     Add more pages with **distill** articles  
-     Go over article features, such as citations, references, and appendices
-     Add links to other articles to website menu pages  
-     Add drop down menus to website navigation bar

--

*Before we begin:*

Make sure you either have your own `.bib` file or saved `article1.bib` from the class website onto your computer. On Windows + Chrome I right-clicked the file and used `Save as` to save.

---

## Resources

- The **distill** website has articles on [**distill** article basics](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/basics.html) as well as [citations](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html)  
- GitHub docs has an overview of publishing via GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)  

.center[
```{r distillery, echo = FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/distill.png")
```
]

---

## Why work with distill articles?

**distill** articles are R Markdown documents with HTML output [optimized for scientific and technical communication](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/07/distill/#what-is-distill). 

It is **distill** articles that we used to build a **distill** website last week and we'll continue with them today, adding more content to your website.  

--

We'll do a quick overview of a few of the `r emo::ji("bell")``r emo::ji("bell")` and whistles today.  Including:  
- Creating a citation entry  
- Adding references using a `.bib` file
- Using footnotes, asides, and appendices

But you can do so much more! Refer to the [**distill** basics](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/basics.html) overview as you start to write your own articles.

# <font style="font-family: cursive; font-style:italic">Let's get started!</font>

---

## Create new distill article

Make sure you have your website RStudio Project open and ready to go. 

Create a new folder called `articles` in the root directory. We'll save the new articles there.

--

Go to `File > New File > R Markdown...`

Click `From Template` and then choose `Distill Article`.

.center[![](figs/week03_files/new_article.png)]

---

## Create new distill article

Save the file as `article1.Rmd` into the `articles` folder.

Give the article a `title` (I used `"My first article"`) and then knit it to see the output based on the "filler" content.

.center[
```{r article1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week03_files/first_article.png")
```
]

---

## Author information


You can see in the output that **distill** articles add author and author affiliation information at the top of the output.  

If you have multiple authors, add a new `- name` entry.

I'm going to add myself as the second author. I include my affiliation but don't include any URL's so no links are added. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
 title: "My first article"
 description: |
   A new article created using the Distill format.
author:
   - name: Nora Jones 
     url: https://example.com/norajones
     affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
     affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
*  - name: Ariel Muldoon
*    affiliation: College of Forestry
 date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
 output: distill::distill_article
```

???

Like always when working with the YAML header, be very careful with your spacing. Using correct indentations is important.

---

## Author information

.pull-left[
After knitting:
.center[![](figs/week03_files/author_article.png)]
]

.pull-right[
You can see this might be useful if you were authoring a new article on the web or if you were giving an overview of a published article.

If you don't want any author information, delete the whole `author:` section from the header.
]

---

## Citeable web article

If you are creating a stand-alone web article or presentation, you can add a citation by adding the appropriate URL to `citation_url` in the header. 

We don't currently have a URL for `article1` so I'll put in a filler to show what the output looks like. Note there are no spaces before `citation_url`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
title: "My first article"
description: |
  A new article created using the Distill format.
author:
  - name: Nora Jones 
    url: https://example.com/norajones
    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
  - name: Ariel Muldoon
    affiliation: College of Forestry
*citation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: distill::distill_article
```

---

## Citeable web article

After knitting, scroll down to the bottom of the output page. You now have a citation for the page and a BibTeX entry that readers can easily copy and paste.

.center[![](figs/week03_files/citation_web.png)]

---

## Citeable journal article

If you want a journal citation, add information from the published article to the header. This would make sense if you were, say, putting the abstract of a published journal article in the **distill** document or writing a journal article.

--

I'll change the `title`, `date`, and basic `author` info and then add the `journal` title, `volume`, and `doi`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
title: "Consequences of reduced light for flower production in conifer-invaded meadows of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A"
author:
  - name: Jessica Celis 
    affiliation: Institute for Applied Ecology
  - name: Charles B. Halpern
    affiliation: School of Environmental and Forest Sciences
  - name: Ariel Muldoon
    affiliation: College of Forestry
*journal: Plant Ecology
*volume: 220
*doi: "10.1007/s11258-019-00952-x"
date: "August 05, 2019"
output: distill::distill_article
```

---

## Citeable journal article

.pull-left[
Now the citation at the bottom of the output is for the journal article.

.center[![](figs/week03_files/citation_journal.png)]
]

.pull-right[
The BibTeX output is named using a *slug*, which it create automatically based on the given information. In this example it is `celis2019consequences`.  You can set this manually using the `slug` option in the header, as well.
]

---

## Citing other works

We can include citations in text and a list of references in the **distill** article if we provide a bibliography file. This can be, e.g., a BibTeX or CSL. document.  

Save the `article1.bib` file I provided you into the `articles` folder. Then refer to it via `bibliography` in the YAML header.

Here is an excerpt of the current YAML header:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
volume: 220
doi: "10.1007/s11258-019-00952-x"
date: "August 05, 2019"
output: distill::distill_article
*bibliography: article1.bib
```

---

## Citing other works

.pull-left[
If you haven't seen a `.bib` file before, take a minute to open `article1.bib` and look at the entries   

These particular citations are for R and R packages. Each entry has been given a name, which is the very first thing in the entry.  
]

.pull-right[
For example, the entry for R is called `R-base`. This name is how we'll refer to the citation in the text.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
*@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2021},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```
]

---

## Citing other works

.pull-left[
You cite using `@` with the `.bib` file entry name. To put citations in parentheses, use brackets.

For example, I'll add the following to the text of `article1.Rmd` to cite R.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
All analyses were done using R 4.0.4 [@R-base].
```

A `References` section is added to the output automatically.

]

--

.pull-right[
After knitting:
.center[![](figs/week03_files/reference.png)]
]

.footnote[*If you want a specific style for references, see instructions on how to change citation style in the [R Markdown Cookbook*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html#changing-citation-style).]

---

## Citing other works

.pull-left[
By default, only references you refer to in the text are included in the output.  If you want all entries in the `.bib` filed added to the references, add

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nocite: '@*'
```

to the YAML header.
]

--

.pull-right[
After adding this to `article1.Rmd` and knitting, all references in the `.bib` file are included.
![](figs/week03_files/reference_all.png)
]

---

## Create another distill article

Make another new distill article and save it as `article2.Rmd` in the `articles` folder.

We'll leave the YAML header info alone this time, and focus on the syntax for footnotes, asides, and appendices.  

---

### Footnotes

.pull-left[
The syntax for adding hoverable footnotes is `^[text]`. Footnotes are automatically numbered.

Let's add some text to the body of `article2.Rmd` to try this out. 

The text I used:

```
Sometimes all the information is not in the body ^[Because it is in the footer]. 
When you do that you'll add footnotes ^[By adding footnote syntax].
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Which results in:
.center[![](figs/week03_files/footnotes.png)]
]

---

### Asides

An *aside* is when you put information to the far right of the document in what is called the *gutter*. The gutter is a used, for example, in Edward Tufte's books.

The syntax for an aside is `<aside></aside>`. 

--

Asides can be text. 

```
<aside>
This comment is on the side.
</aside>
```

--

They can also be output from code chunks such as plots.

    <aside>
    `r ''````{r} 
    plot(cars) 
    `r ''````
    </aside>

---

### Asides

After adding the two examples to `article2.Rmd`, knit to see the output.


.center[
```{r aside, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week03_files/asides.png")
```
]

---

### Appendices

Appendices are added at the end of the document by adding `{.appendix}` after any level 1 (`#`) or level 2 (`##`) header.

This makes sense for, e.g., acknowledgements or author's notes.

--

<br/><br/>
Let's add the following to the text in `article2.Rmd` to see this in action.
<br/><br/>
```
## Acknowledgments {.appendix}

You can recognize people and institutions in acknowledgments. 
```

---

### Appendices

An appendix is put at the bottom of the article, placed before any footnotes.

.center[
```{r appendix, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/week03_files/appendix.png")
```
]

---

## Adding articles as links

Now that we have some "articles" of our work to share, let's add them to the website.

For a website like the one we've made, one approach is to link to the article output within one of our menu pages.

--

Open `about.Rmd`. Remember that the output of this is associated with the `Publications` menu on the website.

As a reminder, here's the `navbar` code from `_site.yml`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 navbar:
   right:
     - text: "Hello"
       href: index.html
*    - text: "Publications"
*      href: about.html
     - text: "Teaching"
       href: teaching.html
     - icon: fab fa-github
       href: https://github.com/aosmith16/personal-website
```

---

## Adding articles as links

We'll add the articles as if they contained information for each element in a list of publications, hence we are working in the `Publications` menu.

--

<br/>
Here's the text I added to `about.Rmd` to do this.

```
## Current publications

- [Consequences of reduced light for flower production in conifer-invaded meadows of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A](articles/article1.html)

- [Another article](articles/article2.html)
```

---

### Relative links

.pull-left[
You can see in the code in the last slide that we refer to files in child folders using paths *relative* to the root directory.

So `articles/article2.html` 
- Points first to the `articles` folder in the root directory 
- And then to the `article2.html` file within that folder.
]

.pull-right[
Here's what my root directory looks like right now:
![](figs/week03_files/root_directory.png)
]

--

**Important**: Only files in the root directory are re-created when you build. You must knit other files manually if you make changes to them.

---

## Adding articles as links

.pull-left[
Once you build the website, the information in the `Publications` menu reflects what we added to `about.Rmd`.  

![](figs/week03_files/publications_link.png)
]

--

.pull-right[
**Of note:** Links to articles in child folders do not have the navigation bar or the website theme. 

Some options:
- Add themes via css files to individual articles like we did to the website.  
- To make a page part of the website (with the navigation bar) it must either be in the root directory or you can switch to using [**distill** blog posts](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog_workflow.html) (*not covered in this session*).  
]

---

## Adding articles as drop-down menus

.pull-left[
Another option is to make drop-down menus to link to your articles. This might make most sense when you want to link to a relatively small number of pages.

You make drop-down menus under `navbar` in `_site.yml`. 
]

--

.pull-right[
The key is to add `menu:` below the `text` and then adding text and `href` links. 

Here I added the two articles as a drop-down menu under "Teaching".


```{r, eval = FALSE}
 navbar:
   right:
     - text: "Hello"
       href: index.html
     - text: "Publications"
       href: about.html
     - text: "Teaching"
*      menu:
*        - text: "First article"
*          href: articles/article1.html
*        - text: "Second article"
*          href: articles/article2.html
     - icon: fab fa-github
       href: https://github.com/aosmith16/personal-website
```
]

---

## Adding articles as drop-down menus

After building the site you'll see the new drop-down menus with links to the articles.

## Deploying website

Once we have a working draft of our website, it's time to deploy. `r emo::ji("grin")`

We set things up to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for this. (*But also see [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).*)

--

<br/>
`r emo::ji("thinking")` Did you forget to push local changes to GitHub? If so, do it now before proceeding.

--

<br/>
Go to your website GitHub repository and then go to `Settings`.

.center[
![](figs/week03_files/github_settings.png)
]

---

class: hide-logo

## Deploying website

Once you are in `Settings`, scroll down, down, down to the section called `GitHub Pages`. It is one section from the very end of the page.

.center[
![](figs/week03_files/github_pages.png)
]

---

class: hide-logo

## Deploying website

.pull-left[
From the drop-down menu under `Source`, select `main`.

![](figs/week03_files/pages_main.png)
]

--

.pull-right[
Then from the next drop-down menu select `/docs`. 

![](figs/week03_files/pages_docs.png)

]

---

class: hide-logo

## Deploying website

.pull-left[
Finally, hit the `Save` button to save these settings.

![](figs/week03_files/pages_save.png)
]

--

.pull-right[

Refresh the `Settings` page and scroll back down to the `GitHub Pages` section. You are waiting (and waiting `r emo::ji("stopwatch")`) to see the message:

`Your site is published at https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

Where `username` is your GitHub user name and `repository-name` is the name of the repository with the website.
]

--

<br/><br/>
.center[Once you see that message, go to the link to view your *live* website. `r emo::ji("tada")`]

???

Don't click on things to early or you may get a 404 message. Clear cache or unpublish by selecting "None" and then do the process again but wait a little more patiently. (https://github.community/t/pages-user-site-not-published/10280/3)

---

class: hide-logo

## Deploying website

A couple other things:

- Whenever you edit your website and push the changes to GitHub your website will automatically update. Be sure to wait several minutes before checking if the updates took. `r emo::ji("wink")`

- If you want to take your website down, go back to `Settings > GitHub Pages`, choose `None` as the source, and `Save`. 

.center[![](figs/week03_files/pages_main.png)]

---

class: hide-logo

## Search engine optimization

You are going to find that your website does not come up at first when you search your name. `r emo::ji("disappointed")` 

But this should change over time! `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")` If not, you may want to research search engine optimization (SEO) to see what you can do to make your website associated with your name in search results.

--

A few ideas:

- Having your name as your site title should be a good start.  
- If you ever decide to get a custom domain, use your name as part of the website address.   
- Make sure you link to your website far and wide. This means, e.g., adding it as your website in all your social media accounts.

---

class: hide-logo

## Next week

That's all we're going to do on websites in this class. Hopefully you have a good start! `r emo::ji("hug")`

Next week we'll switch to making tables using package **gt**.

.center[
```{r gt, echo = FALSE, out.width = "15%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/gtlogo.svg")
