Use this document to follow along with the **gt** basics working session, running provided code to see how it works as well as writing your own practice code. I recommend turning on the visual editor via the ![](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/images/visual_mode_2x.png){width="3%"} button in the right-hand corner.

You can find today's slides [here](). The slides contain introductory material as well as a list of resources that aren't included here.

## R packages

Be sure to run code chunks in order, starting with loading packages.

The main package we're using today is **gt**, but we'll also use packages **dplyr** and **tidyr** for data manipulation. Be sure your package versions are up to date.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(gt) # v. 0.2.2
library(dplyr) # v. 1.0.5
library(tidyr) # v 1.1.3
```

## The datasets

We will primarily work with built-in datasets today. Creating display tables is generally going to involve data manipulation. This can be done in the same code pipeline as making the table, and many **gt** examples will include data manipulation code along with the table-making code.

I want to focus in on just table features today, though, so we'll begin by creating very small examples from the datasets that ship with the **gt** package.

### The `countrypops` dataset

This dataset contains yearly populations of countries, with data from 1960 to 2017. See `?countrypops` for more info.

We'll pare things down to two countries and 5 years.

```{r}
pops_small = countrypops %>%
    filter(country_name %in% c("Vietnam", "Egypt") &
               year > 2012) %>% 
    select(country_name, year, population)
pops_small
```

### Wide `countrypops` dataset

Let's reshape the last dataset so years are the columns.

```{r}
pops_wide = pivot_wider(
    data = pops_small,
    names_from = year,
    values_from = population
)
pops_wide
```

### The `sza` dataset

This dataset contains the solar zenith angles every half hour for different latitudes of the northern hemisphere. See `?sza` for more info.

We'll get the values for the 50th latitude only for all months and then widen so we have a column for each time and a rows for each month. Only keep times with a solar zenith for all months (i.e., 0830 to 1200).

```{r}
sza50 = sza %>%
    filter(latitude == 50 & !is.na(sza)) %>%
    select(-latitude) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = tst,
                values_from = sza) %>%
    select(1:9)
sza50
```

### Dataset with images

Here is a very small dataset so we can practice adding images into tables. It contains made-up CRAN download information for March 30 for 3 packages, **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, and **tidyr**, along with links to their hex sticker images.

```{r}
pack_down = data.frame(
    hex = c("https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png",
            "https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png",
            "https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png"),
    package = c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr"),
    downloads = c(60400, 60255, 29990)
)
pack_down
```

## Add color to table cells

We can use colors to add information to a table or help tell the story of the table visually.

This is done using the [`data_color()` function](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/data_color.html) along with the `col_*()` functions from package **scales** that will map data values to colors based on a palette.

We can set or choose the `palette` in the `scales::col_()` functions. The palette can be:

> 1.  A character vector of RGB or named colours. Examples: palette(), c("#000000", "#0000FF", "#FFFFFF"), topo.colors(10)
>
> 2.  The name of an RColorBrewer palette, e.g. "BuPu" or "Greens".
>
> 3.  The full name of a viridis palette: "viridis", "magma", "inferno", or "plasma".
>
> 4.  A function that receives a single value between 0 and 1 and returns a colour. Examples: colorRamp(c("#000000", "#FFFFFF"), interpolate="spline").

### Fill color, numeric column

We'll start be setting the fill color of the `population` column of `pops_small`. 

We choose the `columns` of interest and then set the colors using `scales::col_numeric()`. I chose the "Greens" palette from **RColorBrewer**.

Use `domain = NULL` so the range of the values is taken from the table.

```{r, message = FALSE}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(population),
        colors = scales::col_numeric(
            palette = "Greens",
            domain = NULL
        )
    )
```

You can use different fill colors on different columns by using multiple `data_color()` layers.

This time I provide a character vector of named colors to use but we can also use hexadecimal codes. Change the transparency of the colors used with `alpha` in `data_color()`.

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(population),
        colors = scales::col_numeric(
            palette = "Greens",
            domain = NULL
        )
    ) %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(year),
        colors = scales::col_numeric(
            palette = c("white", "orange", "red"),
            domain = NULL
        ),
        alpha = .5
    )
```

### Fill color, many columns

You can create a *heat map* vibe in a table with many columns of similar values, applying the same color scale across all columns together. This is done by choosing more `columns`.

We'll choose all columns in `sza50` except the first one using `contains()`. We cannot currently use code like `vars(col1:col3)`, although that should be [fixed in the future](https://github.com/rstudio/gt/issues/611).

To use the color scheme across all columns we need to set the `domain` using the range of values from the entire dataset. I use some helper functions from **dplyr** to get only the numeric columns when calculating the range.

I use the "magma" palette, one of 4 viridis palettes provided in `scales::col_*().`

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = contains("0"),
        colors = scales::col_numeric(
            palette = "magma",
            domain = range(select(sza50, where(is.numeric)))
            )
    )
```
Note we can reverse the order of a palette (so light to dark instead of dark to light) using `reverse` in `scales::col_numeric()`.

### Fill color, categorical column

We can use colors in categorical columns, as well. We need to provide one color for every category in the column, and the colors are used in the order they appear.

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(country_name),
        colors = c("red","blue"),
        alpha = .5
    )
```

At the moment you cannot provide a named vector of colors in **gt** to map each category to each color like you can in **ggplot2**. However, using `scales::col_factor()` and manually putting in the `domain` and `ordered = TRUE` will allow us to assign colors to the correct factor levels.

In this example we have a named vector of colors. Maybe we created it when we were making a plot. We can pass this vector to `palette`, the *names* of the vector to `domain`, and then use `ordered = TRUE`.

```{r}
my_colors = c(Vietnam = "red", Egypt = "blue")
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(country_name),
        colors = scales::col_factor(
            palette = my_colors,
            domain = names(my_colors),
            ordered = TRUE
        ),
        alpha = .5
    )
```

### Text color, categorical column

By default `data_color()` is applied to the cell fill. If you want do change the text color instead use `apply_to = "text"`. Note this is an argument to `data_color()`, not `scales::col_factor()`.

This would be a way to consistently apply colors to factor levels every time you used them without filling the entire cell, which can look a little heavy to my eye.

I'll use the "viridis" palette, one of 4 viridis palettes provided in `scales::col_*().`

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = vars(country_name),
        colors = scales::col_factor(
            palette = "viridis",
            domain = NULL
        ),
        apply_to = "text"
    )
```

### Text color, binning numeric column

Binning numeric variables into groups and then coloring the groups is another option available using the `scales::col_bin()` function.

Working with `sza50`, we'll color text of cells below 45 as orange and 45 or higher as medium gray.

The `bins` argument is key here, where we cut the values up into values between 0 and 45 and then between 45 and 90. If we had a value that was exactly equal to 45 it would be placed in the second group. 

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    data_color(
        columns = contains("0"),
        colors = scales::col_bin(
            palette = c("orange", "grey54"),
            bins = c(0, 45, 90)
        ),
        apply_to = "text"
    )
```

If you want equally sized bins, set `bins` to the number of groups you want.

### Your turn

Write code in the empty code chunk below.

Working with `pops_wide`:

-   Fill all the numeric columns with color, using the `"YlOrRd"` palette from **RColorBrewer**. Make sure to base the domain on the range of the values from the entire dataset.
-   Color the text of `country_name`, using "#1c5253" for Egypt and "#F4790B" for Vietnam.

```{r}
# Write your code in this chunk and run to see the output

```

## Highlight cell text

You can bring attention to certain table cells by changing their text style like color or size or making the whole cell a different color. This is a type of *table styling*, and this (and many other things!) can be done using the `tab_style()` function.

Helper functions such as `cell_text()` for changing the cell text and `cell_fill()` for controlling the cell fill are used to define the cell style.

### Highlighting a single value

Let's say we wanted to highlight a single value in a table. This could be, e.g., something we'd like to bring attention to discuss. 

In this case we'll highlight the 2017 Egypt population value in `pops_small`.

Our first step is to choose the `style` in `tabs_style()`. Here we'll use `cell_text()` to make the text red and bold.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't run this code
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(
            color = "red",
            weight = "bold"
        ),
        ...
    )
```

Then we have to define where exactly we want to change the style using the `locations` argument. In the `location` argument we choose what part of the table we're working in. For highlighting cells this will be the `cells_body()`.

In `cells_body()` we'll define the columns we want to focus on in the standard way. We also need to choose the rows of interest. This can be done using the row index.

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(
            color = "red",
            weight = "bold"
        ),
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(population),
            rows = 5
        )
    )
```

We could focus on the cell fill instead using `cell_fill()` for the style function. Here we'll choose the `rows` of interest using a logical statement. The cell we want is the maximum value in the `population` column, which we use to pick that cell.

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(
            color = "red",
            alpha = .5
        ),
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(population),
            rows = population == max(population)
        )
    )
```

Another `style` function you might want to explore is `cell_borders()`, to change the borders of certain cells.

### Highlighting sets of values

We can highlight a set of values in much the same way. For example, maybe we want to highlight the population values before 2015 as red and italic and after 2015 as blue.

Since we want to highlight to sets of values we'll need to use two layers of `tab_styles()`.

```{r}
pops_small %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(
            color = "red",
            style = "italic"
        ),
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(population),
            rows = year < 2015
        )
    ) %>%
        tab_style(
        style = cell_text(color = "blue"),
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(population),
            rows = year >= 2015
        )
    )
```

### Highlighting rows across many columns

We've been highlighting values within one column, but the process works the same way if we want to highlight across many columns. However, this only allows us to highlight whole rows a certain way.

Switching to the `sza50` dataset, say we wanted to highlight the row for January. We'll increase the size to 20 pixels and make it blue.

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_text(
            color = "blue",
            size = px(20)
        ),
        locations = cells_body(
            rows = month == "jan"
        )
    )
```

### Your turn

Write code in the empty code chunk below.

Working with `pops_wide`:

-   Make the text of all population values for Vietnam purple and bold.
-   Make the cell fill for the 2017 population value for Egypt black with an alpha of 0.5.

**Note**: If you are using column names that are not syntactically valid, such as numeric column names, you must wrap the name in back-ticks: `` `2015` ``

```{r}
# Write your code in this chunk and run to see the output

```

## Include images

You can include images in a table, most often to represent the categories on rows. For example, you'll see tables of country-level information that add in a column with each country's flag (example from Liam D. Bailey [here](https://www.liamdbailey.com/post/making-beautiful-tables-with-gt/)) or sports teams with a column of their logos (example from the Mockup blog [here](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-26-functions-and-themes-for-gt-tables/#pff)).

This process is specifically for making HTML tables. You can also save the table as an image file if you want to insert it into other types of documents.

The work-horse for this is `text_transform()` in combination with `web_image()` if you provide URL 's to images online or `local_image()` if you are providing paths to local copies of images. See other available **gt** image functions [here](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/index.html#section-image-addition-functions).

The first thing to do in `text_transform()` is to define the `locations` we want to work on, much like we did in the highlighting section above. We're working in the cells of the table so will use `cells_body()`. There we choose the column with cells we want to transform, `hex`.

Here's what just that part of the code looks like.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't run this code
pack_down %>%
    gt() %>%
    text_transform(
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(hex)
        ),
        ...
    )
```

Once we've outlined where in the table we want to work we need to provide a function to the `fn` argument to indicate how we want to transform the text. 

Here we want to use `web_image()` to turn the URLs into into an HTML image tag.

Let's go ahead and remove the `hex` column label, as well.

```{r}
pack_down %>%
    gt() %>%
    text_transform(
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(hex)
        ),
        fn = web_image
    ) %>%
    cols_label(
        hex = ""
    )
```

In `web_image()` we can set the height (in pixels) of the image, which controls the image size in the table. 

To do this we need a function that passes the URL into `web_image()` and sets the `height`.

```{r}
pack_down %>%
    gt() %>%
    text_transform(
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(hex)
        ),
        fn = function(url) {
            web_image(url = url,
                      height = 50)
        }
    )
```


See example of adding *icons* from **fontawesome** [here](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook-advanced.html#Add_icons).

### Note on local images

A local image is an image that you have stored on your computer and you have a path and file name for the image.

Instead of providing a URL you will provide the path to the image. If the image is in your working directory this could be as simple as providing the name of the image (e.g., `"myimage.png"`). It could also involve a longer directory path (e.g., `"path/to/my/image/myimage.png"`).

If you want to include a local image in a **gt** table you have to use slightly more complex code compared to the example above. The `local_image()` function works on one image path at a time rather than a vector of images like `web_image()` does.

What does this mean for the coding? You'll need to add a loop in the `fn` to loop through each image.

Here is some pseudo-code to show what this would look like using `lapply()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't run this code
data_with_local_image %>%
    gt() %>%
    text_transform(
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = vars(image) # Column with local path to images
        ),
        fn = function(path) {
            lapply(path, # Loop through each path in col "image"
                   local_image, # local_image() embeds the image into the table
                   height = 50) # Control the height
        }
    )
```

## Creating table themes

We explored just a few of the table output options last week. Now we'll talk about taking those options and turning them into a *theme*. 

A table theme is a function that sets the table options and overall table styling that you can apply to any table.  

### A basic theme

A theme is created by making a function that takes a **gt** table, applies styling elements to that table, and then returns the new table. Adding `…` to both the table arguments and inside `tab_options()` allows the user to add in additional elements, as needed.

Let's start by making a theme called `mytheme` that uses the table options from the final exercise.

```{r}
mytheme = function(table, ...) {
    table %>%
        tab_options(
            table.border.top.color = "white",
            heading.border.bottom.color = "black",
            row_group.border.top.color = "black",
            row_group.border.bottom.color = "white",
            stub.border.color = "transparent",
            table.border.bottom.color = "white",
            column_labels.border.top.color = "black",
            column_labels.border.bottom.color = "black",
            table_body.border.bottom.color = "black",
            table_body.hlines.color = "white",
            ...
    )
}
```

This function can be added as a layer onto any **gt** table.

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    mytheme()
```

Because we used the `…` in the function we can pass additional elements to `tab_options()`.

Let's change the font color to blue. Remember that there are many, many elements we can control in `tab_options()`.

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    mytheme(table.font.color = "blue")
```

### More complex themes

If you are styling your table to match specific manuscript criteria or want to mimic a style online your theme will get more complex. Luckily other people have made themes for **gt** tables already. I'm guessing there will be more as the package ages.

Let's look at a few examples of themes people have built.

First up is a APA theme by [Anthony Schmidt](https://www.anthonyschmidt.co/post/2020-06-03-making-apa-tables-with-gt/). Additional options to `tab_options()` is not included here. But note how this uses additional layers beyond `tab_options()`.

```{r}
theme_apa = function(table) {
    table %>%
        tab_options(
            table.border.top.color = "white",
            heading.title.font.size = px(16),
            column_labels.border.top.width = 3,
            column_labels.border.top.color = "black",
            column_labels.border.bottom.width = 3,
            column_labels.border.bottom.color = "black",
            table_body.border.bottom.color = "black",
            table.border.bottom.color = "white",
            table.width = pct(100),
            table.background.color = "white"
        ) %>%
        cols_align(align="center") %>%
        tab_style(
            style = list(
                cell_borders(
                    sides = c("top", "bottom"),
                    color = "white",
                    weight = px(1)
                ),
                cell_text(
                    align="center"
                ),
                cell_fill(color = "white", alpha = NULL)
            ),
            locations = cells_body(
                columns = everything(),
                rows = everything()
            )
        ) %>%
        opt_align_table_header(align = "left")
}
```

And here's what that looks like in use.

```{r}
sza50 %>%
    gt() %>%
    theme_apa()
```

The [Advanced cookbook](https://themockup.blog/static/gt-cookbook-advanced.html#Create_a_theme) for **gt** on the Mockup blog demonstrates some additional theme examples.

Here's the theme from there that is based on the tables at FiveThirtyEight.

```{r}
gt_theme_538 = function(data,...) {
    data %>%
        opt_all_caps()  %>%
        opt_table_font(
            font = list(
                google_font("Chivo"),
                default_fonts()
            )
        ) %>%
        tab_style(
            style = cell_borders(
                sides = "bottom", color = "transparent", weight = px(2)
            ),
            locations = cells_body(
                columns = TRUE,
                # This is a relatively sneaky way of changing the bottom border
